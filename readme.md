# Prettier Plugin: Organize Imports

> Make sure that your import statements stay consistent no matter who writes them and what their preferences are.

A plugin that makes Prettier organize your imports (i. e. sorts, combines and removes unused ones) using the `organizeImports` feature of the TypeScript language service API. This is the same as using the "Organize Imports" action in VS Code.

**Features**

- üëå Dependency-free (just peer-dependencies you probably already have).
- üí™ Supports `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx` and `.vue` files.
- üöÄ Zero config.
- ü§ì No more weird diffs or annoying merge conflicts in PRs caused by import statements.
- ü§Ø If your editor supports auto-imports, you'll stop thinking about your imports so much that you won't even care about their order anymore.

**Caveat**

This plugin inherits, extends and overrides the built-in Prettier parsers for `babel`, `babel-ts`, `typescript` and `vue`, i. e., it's incompatible with other plugins that do the same... so only the last loaded plugin that exports one of those parsers will function.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev prettier-plugin-organize-imports
```

_`prettier` and `typescript` are peer dependencies, so make sure you have those installed in your project._

## Usage

The plugin will be loaded by Prettier automatically. No configuration needed.

Note: Yarn 2 [does not yet support](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/8474) automatic plugin discovery. [See the prettier documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/plugins.html) on plugins for alternatives to manually load them when using Yarn 2.

Files containing the substring `// organize-imports-ignore` or `// tslint:disable:ordered-imports` are skipped.

### Vue.js

**TL;DR:** Make sure that you have either `@vue/compiler-sfc` (for Vue 3.x) or both `@vue/component-compiler-utils` and `vue-template-compiler` (for Vue 2.x) installed.

```
npm i --save-dev @vue/compiler-sfc
```

or

```
npm i --save-dev @vue/component-compiler-utils vue-template-compiler
```

The `vue` parser of Prettier splits the SFC (single file component) into its blocks and then runs each block through their respective "child" parser, i.&nbsp;e. `typescript` for a `<script lang="ts">` block. This plugin would then preprocess the script content to organize the imports. However Prettier has a [bug](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/11206) with the `preprocess` hook when called in a child parser, which causes broken code around comments and other things. Therefore some work was necessary to do the import organizing on the parent parser level already; this requires some manual parsing using the aforementioned packages. Hopefully Prettier will fix this bug soon so that this whole readme section and the extra code can be deleted and _it just works‚Ñ¢Ô∏è_ again ü§ì

### Debug Logs

If something doesn't work, you can try to prefix your command with `DEBUG=true` which will enable this plugin to print some logs.

## Rationale/Disclaimer

This plugin acts outside of [Prettier's scope](https://prettier.io/docs/en/rationale#what-prettier-is-_not_-concerned-about) because _"Prettier only prints code. It does not transform it."_, and technically sorting is a code transformation because it changes the AST (this plugin even removes code, i. e. unused imports). In my opinion however, the import statements are not _really_ part of the code, they are merely directives that instruct the module system where to find the code (only true as long as your imports are side-effects free regarding the global scope, i. e. import order doesn't matter), comparable with `using` directives in C# or `#include` preprocessing directives in C. Therefore the practical benefits outweigh sticking with the philosophy in this case.

## Changelog

Version `2.3.4` fixes an issue with Vue 2 files.

Version `2.3.3` fixes a bug where default imports were removed erroneously.

Version `2.3.1` adds debug logs and fixes Vue.js support.

Version `2.2.0` adds a compiler options cache to improve performance.

Version `2.1.0` adds support for Vue.js (`.vue` files).

Version `2.0.0` adds support for the parsers `babel` (i. e. JavaScript) and `babel-ts` which are only available since Prettier v2 (and thus the peer dependency has received a major bump).
