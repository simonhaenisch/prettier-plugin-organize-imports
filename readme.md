# Prettier Plugin: Organize Imports

> Make sure that your import statements stay consistent no matter who writes them and what their preferences are.

A plugin that makes Prettier organize your imports (i. e. sorts, combines and removes unused ones) using the `organizeImports` feature of the TypeScript language service API. This is the same as using the "Organize Imports" action in VS Code.

**Features**

- ðŸ‘Œ Dependency-free (just peer-dependencies you probably already have).
- ðŸ’ª Supports `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx` and `.vue` files.
- ðŸš€ Zero config.
- ðŸ¤“ No more weird diffs or annoying merge conflicts in PRs caused by import statements.
- ðŸ¤¯ If your editor supports auto-imports, you'll stop thinking about your imports so much that you won't even care about their order anymore.

**Caveat**

This plugin inherits, extends, and then overrides the built-in Prettier parsers for `babel`, `babel-ts`, `typescript` and `vue`. This means that it is incompatible with other plugins that do the same; only the last loaded plugin that exports one of those parsers will function.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev prettier-plugin-organize-imports
```

_Note that `prettier` and `typescript` are peer dependencies, so make sure you have those installed in your project._

## Usage

### Prettier 3

Automatic plugin discovery [has been removed](https://prettier.io/blog/2023/07/05/3.0.0.html#plugin-search-feature-has-been-removed-14759httpsgithubcomprettierprettierpull14759-by-fiskerhttpsgithubcomfisker). Thus you need to configure Prettier to use the plugin according to the [Plugins docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/plugins.html), for example by adding it to the `plugins` config option:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-organize-imports"]
}
```

### Prettier 2

The plugin will be loaded by Prettier automatically. No configuration needed.

Note that automatic plugin discovery is not supported with some package managers, e. g. Yarn PnP (see https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/8474). In that case follow the instructions for Prettier 3 above.

## Configuration

### Skip Files

Files containing the substring `// organize-imports-ignore` or `// tslint:disable:ordered-imports` are skipped.

### Skip Destructive Code Actions

If you don't want destructive code actions (like removing unused imports), you can enable the option `organizeImportsSkipDestructiveCodeActions` via your Prettier config.

```json
{
  "organizeImportsSkipDestructiveCodeActions": true
}
```

### Mode
Use `organizeImportsMode` to determine how import organization works. This is the recommended approach, as TypeScript has deprecated the [skipDestructiveCodeActions](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/src/services/types.ts#L746C5-L746C31) option.

Available modes include:
- `All` - Performs complete import organization: sorting, combining, and removing unused imports
- `SortAndCombine` - Only sorts and combines imports without removing any
- `RemoveUnused` - Only removes unused imports without changing their order

The default mode is `All`. For compatibility, if `organizeImportsSkipDestructiveCodeActions` is set to `true`, the mode will be forced to `SortAndCombine`.

```json
{
  "organizeImportsMode": 'All'
}
```

## Compatibility

### ESLint

For compatibility with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) or other linters, see ["Integrating with Linters"](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html) in the Prettier docs. You should have any import order rules/plugins disabled.

### React

Depending on your configuration, if you need the `React` import to stay even if it's "unused" (i.e. only needed for the JSX factory), make sure to have the `jsx` option set to `react` in your `tsconfig.json`. For more details [click here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#basic-usage).

### Vue.js

Make sure that you have the optional peer dependency `vue-tsc` installed.

```
npm install --save-dev vue-tsc
```

If you're using Vue.js with Pug templates, you'll also need to install `@vue/language-plugin-pug` as a dev dependency, and configure it in `vueCompilerOptions` (see [usage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/language-plugin-pug)).

## Debug Logs

If something doesn't work, you can try to prefix your `prettier` command with `DEBUG=true` which will enable this plugin to print some logs.

## Rationale/Disclaimer

This plugin acts outside of [Prettier's scope](https://prettier.io/docs/en/rationale#what-prettier-is-_not_-concerned-about) because _"Prettier only prints code. It does not transform it."_, and technically sorting is a code transformation because it changes the AST (this plugin even removes code, i. e. unused imports). In my opinion however, the import statements are not _really_ part of the code, they are merely directives that instruct the module system where to find the code (only true as long as your imports are side-effects free regarding the global scope, i. e. import order doesn't matter), comparable with `using` directives in C# or `#include` preprocessing directives in C. Therefore the practical benefits outweigh sticking with the philosophy in this case.
